What is Network in a Box Web GUI
--------------------------------

A Graphical Web Interface used to create configurations files for YateBTS.

It has tree parts:

1. Subscribers contains: List Subscribers, Online Subscribers, Rejected IMSIs
List Subscribers - each IMSI can be inserted individually or
                   insert a regular expression to be used to match the subscribers IMSIs.

Online Subscribers - lists all the subscribers online.

Rejected IMSIs - lists all the rejected subscribers.

2. BTS Configuration - has all the sections from ybts.conf file that can be configured.
 
3. Outgoing - configure outbound connection On IAX or SIP protocol with their specific parameters.

Requirements
------------

PHP, Apache, YateBTS are required to run the software.

Installing
----------

Depending on your operating system the main web directory will be /var/www (debian based systems) 
or /var/www/html otherwise. If you don't have this path, then you need to install Apache server.

Assuming you install YateBTS package or installed by hand(make install), the UI source code is 
located in /usr/local/share/yate/nib_web.

 > cd /var/www/html   (or cd /var/www on debian based OS)
 > ln -s /usr/local/share/yate/nib_web yatebts_nib


Configuration
-------------

Before using the interface, the permissions for the directories that are 
set in the $yate_conf_dir variable MUST be set.

The command that has to be runned as root (if the default settings are set) is:
chmod -R a+rw /usr/local/etc/yate/ 

Failing to configure the right permissions will make the interface display some errors
the first time when it's used.
